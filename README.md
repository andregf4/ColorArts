# ColorArts
Game made in Swiftui to guess the RGB Color of a random generated color.

There is a circle in the top of the screen, which has to be tapped for its color to change. Once changed, the user have to guess the RGB scale of that color, inputing parameters to R (Red), G (Green) and B (Blue), according to the range of 0 to 255 for each one. After that, there is a pontuation generated at the bottom of the screen, from 0 to 100.
